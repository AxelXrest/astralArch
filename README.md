#### 2. ‚ú® The AstralArch ‚ú®

### About:
* **Foot & Alacritty** as the terminal.
* **Tokyo Night** as the color scheme.
* **Hyprland** as the window manager.
* **AGS** as the widgets [Player and System Menu]
* **AnyRun & Fuzzel** as the application launcher.
* **Dunst** as the notification daemon.
* **AGS** as the main bar.

‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE!!!!!** This configuration was made for my PC, so some things might not work on your PC as this was never intended to be a usable full fledged system, in that case, please try if you can fix that up as much as possible, or you can open an issue for help :)
