### Thanks for Visiting!

Welcome to my GitHub repository of personal dotfile! This was made in Arch Linux so please make sure you are using Arch or try configuring yourself for your device. These are beautifully created with usability and aestheticism kept in mind. Feel free to explore it, use it or ~~steal~~ copy it, but please give me the credits üòÉ. If you need any help, you can open an issue on GitHub or you can contact me on Discord: `mr.xrest`, I will be happy to help!

**THE COLOR SCHEME CHANGES DEPENDING UPON THE WALLPAPER SELECTED**<br>
*(default shortcut to change wallpaper is: CTRL+ü™ü+T)*

üìì **NOTE:**<br> 
* This dotfile is meant to be *more feature oriented **than** visually pleasing*, so if you are searching for that kind, then sadly this isn't it.
* I haven't used any greeter/login manager, rather made a script, to auto-login and start Hyprland in startup.

#### 2. ‚ú® The AstralArch ‚ú®

### About:

* **Foot & Alacritty** as the terminal.
* **Hyprland** as the window manager.
* **AGS** as the widgets [Player and System Menu]
* **AnyRun & Fuzzel** as the application launcher.
* **AGS** as the main bar.

‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE!!!!!** This configuration was made for my PC, so some things might not work on your PC as this was never intended to be a usable full fledged system, in that case, please try if you can fix that up as much as possible, or you can open an issue for help :)

## Installation:

Once Again this configuration and script is made specifically for **ARCH distribution.**
